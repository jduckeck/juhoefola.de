<h2>I. Techniques for Cave Exploration including Rescue Topics</h2>

<p>
    Main topic of this course is to learn solid basic skills in cave exploration.
    There will be topics about ropes and knots, security, rescue, rappelling in
    shafts, rope ladders and single rope techniques (SRT).
</p>

<h2>II. Cave Survey</h2>

<p>
    A detailed cave map is essential for cave research.
    You will learn the basics techniques of cave surveying and how to draw a cave map with a computer (Therion).
    You will train the use of DistoX together with a PDA and you get to know other different surveying equipment like compass and clinometer.
</p>

<h2>III. Biology, Fauna and Eco-Systems in Caves</h2>

<p>
    Methods for gathering information and documentation of the cave fauna will be
    shown.
    You will take probes in a cave and learn how to write documentation and
    interpret the data.
    The result should be to get a feeling about the status of flora and fauna in the
    cave and become more sensible about the cave as a fragile biological system.

<h2>IV. Geology</h2>

<p>
    Geology is investigating how caves form but also delivers valuable information
    for cavers.
    We will learn the basics of geology as reading of geological maps, profiles,
    tectonics, mineralogy and sediments which can show the climate during the last
    thousands of years.
    Depending on the weather situation, we will do practical field work in the
    <b>Geo-Park Schwäbische Alb</b> (Swabian Jura).
    We will hike to a meteor crater, visit remains of volcanism and collect fossils.
</p>

<h2>V. Electronics in Caves</h2>

<p>
    Electronic Radio Direction Finding, Communication in caves thru wire and wireless, GPS
    navigation.
    Theoretical presentations and practical work.
</p>

<h2>VI. Logging of Climate Data in Caves</h2>

<p>
    Equipment for measuring climate relevant parameters and transferring that data
    to the surface.
    Theoretical basics and practical usage of the equipment will be demonstrated.
</p>

<h2>VII. Cave Climate; Theory and Data Evaluation</h2>

<p>
    Introduction into cave climate.
    What is climate in caves, why is it done, cave protection and exploration.
    Air temperature, air circulation measurements in theory and practice.
    How to plan an own project and how to do the data analysis.
</p>


<h2>VIII. Applied Hydrology</h2>

<p>
    Measurements of water drain and water pile up experiments will be done to
    calculate unknown cave volumes behind springs.
    We will also do salt tracer experiments and analysis.
    Theory and practical work will be shown.
</p>

<h2>IX. Palaeontology and Archaeology</h2>

<p>
    Together with a specialist of the national museum for natural history you will look for pre-historic bones in a special district
    and compare these bones with others from the museum.
    You will learn to name these findings.
    We offer you field trips to the caves in the world culture heritage (since 2017) in our region.
